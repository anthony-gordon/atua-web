# Web App for AR_ATUA

Haere Mai! Welcome to the Github home for AR_ATUA's Web App.

This app is intended to help explain the vision of AR_ATUA, the final project of five EDA students: Anthony, Ben, Laura, Maddy, and Zach.  You can view the site here: http://atua-web.herokuapp.com/

AR_Atua is an augmented reality app which places the god Tāwhirimātea on top of Mount Victoria.  The web portion tells the legend of Tāwhirimātea, the background of our team, and helps transmit the spirit of the project by having a fully bilingual site where the english translations reveal themselves through active participation of the viewer.  It is also built ontop of a database designed for translators.  

## The Kaupapa / Vision of our Team
- Remind people of spiritual realms present in the everyday, by creating a new way of seeing the world.
- Our app displays and embodies our values from the bottom to the top.  A holistic approach to web development.
- We do everything meaningfully and with purpose.
- Our project helps people, and we can be proud of it.
- Te Ao Māori through visualization.
- We make life more magical.
- Make New Zealand less racist through shared cultural experience.
- combine maori culture with tech
- Always aim for inclusivity.

So in this case there would be paragraphs we can map over, each paragraph would be an object with a Te Reo and English counterpart that we could put into our <spans>

So upon form submission, the left-hand side would go into paragraphs.tereo and the right-hand side would go into paragraphs.english.  It would then be stringified and added to the DB.
